function [hdwf] = AD2Init(varargin)
% AD2Init - load the library provided by the software development
%kit (SDK) of the Analog Discovery 2 (Waveforms) by Digilent. It will check
%the location of the SDK, load the library, and check if the AD2 is
%present. If all is well, it will return a device ID for further use.
%   Input arguments: 
% hdwf = AD2Init();
%
% hdwf = AD2Init(SDKpath);
%
% By default, this function will assume a windows environment, where the
% SDK is installed in program files. In this case, you can call AD2Init 
% without arguments. If you are working on a Mac, or Linux  system, or if 
% you have provided a non-default installation path, you can provide one 
% yourself, by calling AD2Init(SDKPath) where SDKPath is a string that 
% references to the SDK location. Make sure to include the full path 
% to the dwf.h file, including a trailing / or \!
%
